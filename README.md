# Professional_Portfolio_Artist
immersive 3D portfolio website for a sketch artist.
Features of this portfolio:

3D Interactive Background: Uses Three.js to create a floating "void" of sketchpads and drawings that react to your mouse movement and scrolling.

Procedural Art Generation: Since I cannot access external image files reliably, the code includes a generative art engine that draws "fake" pencil sketches (portraits, landscapes, geometric studies) onto the 3D planes in real-time.

Glassmorphism UI: A modern, clean interface that sits on top of the 3D scene, using Tailwind CSS for responsive layout.

Performance Optimized: Handles window resizing and uses efficient rendering loops.
